				<p class="why">We are Beltline Running Co. Gear made for runners, by runners. Running takes your body, mind, and spirit to a better place. The simple act of putting one foot in front of the other and moving forward can make you healthier, happier, and more confident.
				Like the starting horn at a race, we want to be the “Go!” that gets people running for life. At New York Road Runners, it is our goal to give everyone on the planet both a reason to run and the means and opportunity to keep running and never stop.
				Over the past 55-plus years, we have grown from a local running club to a global champion of the running movement. We are the world’s premier community running organization, and our efforts and events serve all runners and active individuals, from beginners to professional athletes: the young, the elderly, and the underserved of all abilities.</p>
